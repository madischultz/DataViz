# DataViz

Group members: Madi Schultz, Austin Simpson, Diego Lopez Ramos, Tyler Kay

    Our project of incorporating Blockly and custom add-ons for data exploration and visualization in data science has the potential to make it more accessible to a wider audience. It can streamline the process of creating, experimenting with, and sharing data visualizations, ultimately enhancing decision-making across various domains, even outside of data science.
    We will use parsing to interpret and translate the data that is taken in to be visualized. Our project will be able to receive data in different formats, and we will need to parse through it in certain cases to make it easier to interpret. 


***Add paragraph about parsing, interpretation, compilation***
