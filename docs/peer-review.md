Peer Review

We found the peer review process helpful in order to get an outside perspective on our project. Our reviewers were able to point out some forgotten formatting that would have been confusing for users of the blockly. We had some buttons such as "Generate JavaScript" that did not do anything, and they used the issues function to suggest removal of these. Additionally they pointed out some syntax issues in the code that was being generated that we were able to adjust.

It was also valuable to have some peers test it out to make sure our detailed instructions were easy enough to follow. We have since added some new ways to display our visualizations using a server, but overall it is a similar procedure. I believe we didn't accept their pull request because we intentionally did not want to change it exactly as they modified it. Regardless, we were able to make necessary adjustments.
